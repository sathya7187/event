            <p>It is very hard for the new entrants to survive in the fashion industry unless they offer good quality products and up to dated to the trends in the market. There is no such competitor to runnies.com, who offers the customized shoes according to the customer preferences. Offering shoes to the people with inappropriate sizes also gives us the competitive edge over the peers.
